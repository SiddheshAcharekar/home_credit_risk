# HomeCredit Risk Analysis (Originally a Kaggle Problem)
This is my work on the Home Credit risk database. Includes data, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model building for predicting repayment risk.

## Problem
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities. The task therefore is to predict whether a loan applicant will default on his loan or not.

## Dataset
